Ever thought of privacy concerns while using 3rd party apps? If so, docmost is the best solution for you.

[Docmost](https://docmost.com) is an open-source alternative to Confluence and Notion, which you can self-host and all the data stays on your servers. It is build using React, Node.js and PostgreSQL.

Self hosting docmost may sound like a daunting task, but it's not that hard. In this guide, I will show you how to deploy docmost on your VPS and setting it up a custom domain.

## Prerequisites

1. A VPS ofcourse.
1. A domain name.
1. Basic knowledge of Linux and Docker.

## Tools that we will be using

1. Docker
1. Nginx (for reverse proxy)
1. Certbot (for SSL)

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

1. SSH into your VPS. I am using a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04.

```bash
ssh user@your-vps-ip
```

2. Install Docker.

Set up Docker's apt repository.

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the Docker packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

```

3. Install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

## Step 2: Deploying Docmost

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content.

```yaml
services:
  docmost:
    image: docmost/docmost:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    environment:
      APP_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
      APP_SECRET: "REPLACE_WITH_LONG_SECRET"
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://docmost:STRONG_DB_PASSWORD@db:5432/docmost?schema=public"
      REDIS_URL: "redis://redis:6379"
     MAIL_DRIVER: 'smtp'
      SMTP_HOST: 'REPLACE_WITH_SMTP_HOST'
      SMTP_PORT: 'REPLACE_WITH_SMTP_PORT'
      SMTP_USERNAME: 'REPLACE_WITH_SMTP_USERNAME'
      SMTP_PASSWORD: 'REPLACE_WITH_SMTP_PASSWORD'
      MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: 'REPLACE_WITH_SMTP_EMAIL'
      MAIL_FROM_NAME: 'REPLACE_WITH_SMTP_NAME'
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - docmost:/app/data/storage

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: docmost
      POSTGRES_USER: docmost
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: STRONG_DB_PASSWORD
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7.2-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  docmost:
  db_data:
  redis_data:
```

If you want to invite others to use this workspace, you will need to add SMTP variables to send invitation through emails. You can use [Zoho](https://mail.zoho.com) to get free custom emails.

> Make sure to update environment variables with your own values and take a look at [supported variables](https://docmost.com/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables/).

2. Run the following command to run the container.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

3. Visit `http://your-vps-ip:3000` to see docmost running.

## Step 3: Setting up custom domain with Nginx

1. Visit your domain registrar and add an A record pointing to your VPS IP.
2. Create a new Nginx configuration file.

```bash
touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/docmost
```

3. Add the following content to the file.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name <domain_name> www.<domain_name>;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name <domain_name> www.<domain_name>;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:<project_port>/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

> Make sure to replace `<domain_name>` with your domain name and `<project_port>` with the port on which docmost is running.

4. Create a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory.

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/docmost /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/docmost
```

5. Restart Nginx.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 4: Setting up SSL with Certbot

1. Install Certbot.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

2. Obtain SSL certificate.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d <domain_name> -d www.<domain_name>
```

3. Restart Nginx.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully deployed docmost on your VPS and set up a custom domain with a free SSL certificate. You can now access docmost at `https://your-domain.com`.
