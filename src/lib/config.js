    paragraph: `My journey spans the pharmaceutical and
    banking domains, where I’ve had the privilege of solving complex challenges with innovative
    AI-driven solutions. Currently, I’m an Assistant Vice President – Specialist, Machine
    Learning &amp; AI Engineer at DBS Bank, leading the way in designing and implementing
    transformative data and AI solutions that drive success and enhance customer experiences.
    I thrive on exploring creative ways to leverage AI to tackle real-world problems—whether
    it’s optimizing operations or delivering personalized, impactful experiences. My technical
    expertise covers Python and JavaScript development, AWS cloud architecture, ML
    engineering, ML-Ops, and Generative AI.
    When I’m not deep in the tech world, I love sharing my passion through speaking, training,
    and participating in panel discussions at tech conferences on topics like Cloud, Data, and AI.
    Over the years, I’ve also mentored hundreds of professionals, helping them achieve their
    goals and embrace growth confidently.
    For me, it’s all about combining innovation, collaboration, and a forward-thinking mindset to
    create meaningful change. Let’s connect and explore what’s possible together!`,
