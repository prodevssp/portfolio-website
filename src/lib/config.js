    paragraph: `I was born in a small town called Brahmapur (Berhampur) in Odisha, where I completed my schooling and laid the foundation for my academic journey. Later, I moved to Bhubaneswar, the capital city, to pursue my intermediate studies before enrolling in the Gandhi Institute of Engineering and Technology for my undergraduate degree. After graduating, I began my professional journey with Hexaware in Chennai.

    My career has since spanned the pharmaceutical and banking domains, where I’ve had the privilege of solving complex challenges with innovative AI-driven solutions. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Vice President – Specialist, Machine Learning AI Engineer at DBS Bank, leading efforts in designing and implementing transformative data and AI solutions that drive success and enhance customer experiences.

    I thrive on exploring creative ways to leverage AI to tackle real-world problems—whether it’s optimizing operations or delivering personalized, impactful experiences. My technical expertise includes Python and JavaScript development, AWS cloud architecture, ML engineering, ML-Ops, and Generative AI.

    Beyond the tech world, I enjoy sharing my passion through speaking, training, and participating in panel discussions at tech conferences on topics like Cloud, Data, and AI. Over the years, I’ve also mentored hundreds of professionals, helping them achieve their goals and embrace growth confidently.

    For me, it’s all about combining innovation, collaboration, and a forward-thinking mindset to create meaningful change. Let’s connect and explore what’s possible together!`,
